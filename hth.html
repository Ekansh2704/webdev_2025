Personally, I joined VIT for its prestigious reputation, but the more I learn about this college and my own courses, I am baffled by the great hospitality and secularism here.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My course of CSE core consists of various subjects dealing with <b>data structures, mathematics, logic building</b>, and so on. Here, we study together with students from different states and backgrounds, and I have learnt a lot in my first 3 semesters. I am trying my best to learn here, and the sheer amount of competition keeps me motivated about my academics and growth. I am currently in my 4th semester and hope to do even better than before. All previous semesters have been difficult to survive, but <b>giving up is not an option</b> if we have to get a B-Tech degree from such a respected college.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Overall, <b>my aim is to become an icon who people can look up to</b> and be a <b>successful person to support my family and self desires</b>. There is still a lot that needs to be done as my skillset is at amateur levels, and there is a lot I have to understand and grow from my experience. I will continue to strive in this college and graduate with a satisfaction that I never gave up and stood determined.Thank you.</p>
