            My greetings to everyone, <em>I am <span style="color: gold;">Ekansh Kumar</span>, 
            a <b>2nd year student</b> of VIT Vellore</em>, pursuing the branch of 
            <b>CSE Core</b> from 2023 to 2027. Personally, I joined VIT for its prestigious reputation, 
            but the more I learn about this college and my own courses, I am baffled by the great 
            <span style="color: lightblue;">hospitality</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen;">secularism</span> here.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            My course of <b>CSE Core</b> consists of various subjects dealing with 
            <span style="color: cyan;">data structures</span>, 
            <span style="color: lightcoral;">mathematics</span>, 
            <span style="color: yellow;">logic building</span>, and so on. Here, we study together with students 
            from different states and backgrounds, and I have learned a lot in my first 3 semesters. 
            I am trying my best to learn here, and the sheer amount of competition keeps me motivated 
            about my academics and growth. I am currently in my <b>4th semester</b> and hope to do even 
            better than before. All previous semesters have been difficult to survive, but 
            <b style="color: red;">giving up is not an option</b> if we have to get a B-Tech degree 
            from such a respected college.
        </p>
